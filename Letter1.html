            <h7> When will my feelings reach you? Why am I so afraid of what could happen after being honest with my feelings? It might be easy for others to express it, but to me, it is something so special that it requires an amount of courage of accepting that you have been a big portion of my life. All along I thought you were just one of my best friends. As they say, ka-tropa mo nga lang, but little did I know, I started having these thoughts of what ifs. What if you were no longer just a friend? What if I wanted to see you but then Iâ€™d get lost for words because my heart fluttered? What if I actually did like you? <br> <br>

Stage 1 of having a crush is always the denial stage. I tried to believe that these feelings were simply because it felt good to have someone who cared for you, who wanted to spend time with you, and who found you the most comfortable. Later did I know, I started getting distracted because every single thing that I saw felt related to you somehow. Was it really like this when you finally started liking your best friend? Stage 2 was the acceptance stage. Accepting not only your feelings for him but also the fact that you can never be together. Why would I choose my feelings over our friendship? You had your own taste, your own interests in girls, and all I ever was to you was a friend, someone you could go to when you needed something. One thing I hated the most about myself was that I would do everything and anything for you. Sinabihan pa nga nila akong magtira naman sa sarili ko kasi naging mundo kita. When you needed help in your studies, I would always be ready with a helping hand. When you felt sad and wanted ice cream to cheer you up, I was always ready to give you my time to make you happy. But would you actually do the same? Would you actually learn to give me what I deserved too? Did you even for at least consider me as your best friend? <br><br>

This letter is just filled with unanswered questions. Questions I wished you would explain why even with just one word. However, all of these are just in my mind because my feelings can never ever reach you. It would forever remain in me until it is gone. I stayed away, so that this pain would no longer aggravate. You left without a word. Our friendship faded. I guess you actually answered me. You did not need me, but I learned one thing. In love, that special someone was not supposed to be your world but rather just a part of it. I grew and understood more what love is. I learned to make myself happy first before others. But always remember, that as your friend, I will still be here for you no matter what. At the end of the day, why would I waste such a treasured friendship? I just believe that one day you would see this side of the rainbow because I know deep down, you have something in you that others could not see. <br><br>

Are we now strangers? Maybe we already are. Does it still hurt? Yes, I lost a friend. I cannot pinpoint exactly where it hurts, but it really does. Have I moved on? Yes because my life no longer revolved around you, and that was the best gift I could give to myself.</h7>
