            <h7> This last entry for this website is simply a letter to myself to remind me that I deserve so much more. In this fast paced world, always remember that true love will always come in God’s time. It will always be the right person in the right time and place. Sometimes, it is hard to believe when all circumstances do not seem to lead that way, but your faith in Him should always remind you that He has far greater things for you. Remember all those stories of couples who waited for “the one”? If they did not wait, they would have probably been regretting their decisions but instead they found real joy because they chose the path that lead to God’s promise. <br><br>

Never settle for less, okay? Never choose someone who would make you look down on yourself nor make you feel unworthy of things. You are supposed to be treated with respect and love from a man that God has destined you to spend the rest of your life with. You are supposed to create a family who would bring joy not only to you but also to God. <br><br>

However, while the time has not yet arrived, build on your relationship with God and those around you. Know yourself better in accordance to God’s Word and will. Be the best version of yourself, so that when you serve your husband, you would be able to fully give your all. And of course, it is okay to be hurt or to learn from things you experienced. It is all part of life, but remember never to repeat it. Get back at your own feet and be a fighter. Lastly, always remember what Lang Leav said, we do not look for love. Love finds us. </h7>
