            <h7>"There are days when the melancholy settles on you like a sudden change in weather. The kind of sadness that is intangible. Like the presence of an ache where you can't pinpoint exactly where it hurts, you just know it does." -Lang Leav</h7>

            <h7> Watching Korean dramas, I have always wondered what love felt like. Was it all about happy endings and getting the oppa that you have loved from the beginning? However, all of these are just fictional stories. Most girls probably wish to find their one true love, but these come in the right time and right place. When one came along though, I did not know what to do. It felt the most unclear thing that has happened to me. <br><br>

Who even knew I would have met you when we were never even properly introduced? For some reason, someone seemed to have brought us together to meet and know each other alone. In reality, you know how shy I am as a person, but you never stopped giving efforts to find chances in making me comfortable with you, in making me a part of your life. But why is it that everytime I learned new things about you, I felt scared. Whenever you introduced me to your friends, never have I heard anything positive with us being friends. All I heard from them was to stay away from you because I would regret it. You apologize every single time, but was it actually stupid to believe you? Weeks passed, but here I am, still by your side. You slowly stepped into my life, and I also did in yours. But up until now, people just seem to be against it. Was I just one of your girls? Was I just a toy to you? No matter how many times you asked me about my feelings, all I could ever give was vague answers because yes, I felt terrified. I felt scared to even admit that I had this slight feeling for you because I know that you would probably leave me anyway. I just do not understand myself though that despite you telling me about your past, your friends describing who you are to me, I stayed. Was it because I wished that you had something good in you and can probably change? But what if one day, my heart broke so much, and it was all because I was stupid despite all these signs? <br><br>

Sometimes, I wonder why God even allowed us to meet. What was the reason why he brought you to me in an instant? Who are you really? Do I actually know the real you? Would you really hurt me or all of these actions and words are true? Would it be possible for you to just remove this fear to prove to me that you are actually different from what they say, that you would not play with my heart? Can you honestly tell me? <br><br>

One day, when we look back, I hope I would never regret the time I spent with you. When I like someone, it is real. It is something I think about a lot, and help me find a reason to know that staying is worth it.</h7>
